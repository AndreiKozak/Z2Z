 *****  INSTALLATION ******
 
Since it's a shell program, the Z2Z tool does not require installation, just extract its contents, grant permission, and execute the command ./z2z.sh to start the migration process.

The program will check its dependencies and confirm if the administrator wants to proceed before starting the export routines.

 ***** USAGE  ******

# 1. Exportation
 
The Z2Z program must be executed with the Zimbra user on the source server of the migration. Once the execution is confirmed, the program will export information about service classes (COS), accounts, aliases, and distribution lists to the Zimbra directory. This includes preserving all account information, including the password (if external authentication is not used).
*** The administrator can choose whether to import the ADMIN account.

During the account export***, service accounts from Zimbra are excluded from the list, avoiding any impact on the new environment, for example:

- Account for SPAM
- Non-SPAM account (HAM)
- Virus QUARANTINE account
- GALSYNC account
- Service accounts

The program will also allow, at the time of exporting the information, the modification of the Zimbra server hostname, for scenarios where the hostnames of the source and destination servers are different.

At this initial stage, the program DOES NOT EXPORT mailbox content, but generates batch files within the export directory.
This allows the administrator to execute the export according to the migration strategy desired, such as dividing accounts for parallel execution, for example. The batch file is generated with the execution of the native Zimbra command "zmmailbox", which allows the export and import of mailboxes, including:

- Email (preserving folder hierarchy and all message flags)
- Calendar
- Briefcase
- Tasks
- Preferences

To avoid exporting unnecessary content, two separate batch files are created within the export directory for the TRASH and SPAM folders, and it is optional for the administrator to export and/or import these contents.

# 2. Importation
 
For importation, the "export" directory of Z2Z, created on the source server, must be copied in its entirety to the new server. The entire import process will also be executed with the Zimbra user on the new server.

In this version (0.9), environment settings are not being handled, they need to be manually mapped and configured. BEFORE starting the import process, the administrator MUST CREATE ALL DOMAINs OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

Firstly, the importation of LDAP records must be carried out, the "import_ldap.sh" script will perform the necessary checks and execute the import in the correct order.

The importation of mailboxes must be carried out subsequently, executing the "script_import_FULL.sh" script or as defined in the strategy. If the export of the TRASH and/or SPAM folders was carried out, the "script_import_Trash.sh" and "script_import_Junk.sh" scripts must be executed ***.

*** The importation of TRASH and/or SPAM folders must be executed AFTER the main mailbox import. For the main mailbox, the reset method is used, which removes any previous content in the mailbox.
