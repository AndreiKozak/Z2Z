This tool was created to facilitate the migration process between Zimbra environments, regardless of the version or edition being used. Motivated by the challenges encountered in migrations carried out by BKTECH (an official Zimbra partner for business and training), as well as participation in Zimbra communities, the tool aims, as it evolves, to address various scenarios, including the migration from other platforms, both open source and proprietary - "A2Z: Anything/Anywhere to Zimbra."
